# utkarsh-portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built using the SAP UI5 framework.
The website is based on MVC architecture and uses XML-based views, JS controllers and JSON models. 
The version-1 of the website is live now on GitHubPages (but it is currently only optimised for desktop screens, I'm working on the mobile-lite version).
